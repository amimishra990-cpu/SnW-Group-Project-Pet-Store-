- Dedicated species pages: hamster, cat, dog, fish, and bird.
- Supporting pages: About Us, Support, Categories, and user profile pages.
- Unified styling via PetShop.css and additional CSS files for inner pages.
- Organized assets inside Images/ and Video/ folders.

> **Note:** Some folder names contain a trailing space (`Images `, `Inside Webpage `, `Website Code `). Keep these spaces intact when running shell commands or renaming files.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser to view the landing page.  
3. Use the navigation bar or interactive cards to browse the inner pages located in the `Inside Webpage ` directory.

## Customization
- Edit the content directly in the corresponding HTML files.  
- Replace visuals by adding new assets to the `Images ` folder (ensure filenames match the `src` attributes).  
- Modify or expand layouts by editing `PetShop.css` or the page-specific CSS files in `Inside Webpage `.
